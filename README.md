# Online Sales Trend Analysis Using SQL

This project performs sales trend analysis using MySQL on an online sales dataset. The objective is to identify monthly and regional sales patterns, revenue trends, and transactional behavior using SQL aggregation techniques.


##  Project Structure

Online Sales Data.csv`  - Raw dataset containing e-commerce transactions 
task6 sql script.sql`   - SQL script to create the table and run trend analysis queries 
output tables.zip`      - Contains screenshots or exports of query outputs 

##  Task Objective

**Task 6: Sales Trend Analysis Using Aggregations**

 **Tools**: MySQL Workbench
 **Goal**: Analyze sales trends using SQL aggregation queries on order data.

## How It Works

1. **Create Database & Table**
   - The SQL script creates a database named `sales_analysis` and a table `online_sales`.

2. **Load the Dataset**
   - Import `Online Sales Data.csv` into the `online_sales` table using MySQL Workbench or any ETL tool.

3. **Run SQL Queries**:
   - **Monthly Revenue Trends (All Years)**
   - **Monthly Revenue Trends for 2024**
   - **Region-wise Monthly Revenue Trends for 2024**
   - 
4. **Key Insights (Expected from Output)**
Sales peaks during specific months (seasonality)
Regional differences in revenue performance
Overall growth or decline in 2024 compared to prior periods
